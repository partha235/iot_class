This repository is to steady about IoT sing micropython. The main reason for choosing micropython is that it allows to run each line separately as it's an interpreter. In this repository, I'm making things that you need to learn IoT as a beginner. I made every program in this repository with circuit description and as much i try to attach images of it.

When it comes to micropython I preferred to use **ampy module by adafruit** along with VScode or VSCodium (as i use Linux OS). Visit [adafruit ampy page](https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-load-files-and-run-code/install-ampy) to know more about it. I'm also working in a repository of learning micropython from basics where you can get it from my [github page ](https://github.com/partha235/MicroPy.git).
